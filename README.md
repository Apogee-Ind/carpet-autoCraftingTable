# carpet-autoCraftingTable
autoCraftingTable extension for carpet-mod. Implementation based on Skyrising's implementation for autoCraftingTable for QuickCarpet - implemented here as an extension for fabric-carpet mod.

When enabled, all crafting tables will contain block entites making them immovable. This means that items will also be stored inside the crafting table.
